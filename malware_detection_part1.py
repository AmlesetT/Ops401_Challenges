# Script Name:                  Ops 401 - Challenge 31
# Author:                       Amleset Tesfamariam, CF Ops lecture 401, ChatGPT
# Date of latest revision:      03/27/2024
# Purpose:                      To develop a Python script that prompts for file name, user directory, and search files within directory. Then for the script to detail the file name, location, and how many malware were detected.
# Reason:                       It is critical to be able to create and use malware detecting tools to better prevent and help protect sensitive data.

                print(f"Found: {file} - Location: {os.path.join(root, file)}")
            searched_files += 1

    print("\nSearch Summary:")
    print(f"Files Searched: {searched_files}")
    print(f"Hits Found: {hits}")
